     * Your draft code needs to contain a complete set of methods as specified in the assignment.
     * Otherwise, it won't compile with our test suite.  To avoid this, you should first write
     * a complete set of "skeleton" methods, i.e. methods with the correct names and
     * the correct return and argument types.
     *
     * To help ensure your code will compile when you submit it for testing, below we have
	 * included a set of skeleton tests. You should replace these with more meaningful tests
	 * as you write your methods.
